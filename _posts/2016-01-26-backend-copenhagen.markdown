## Back-End Web Developer

We’re looking for a team member with proven back-end development skills, ability to think through technical challenges, define easy to use APIs, and create robust services.

## What we're looking for

- You need to love what you do, have opinions, and get excited about software.
- Strong skills in Ruby on Rails or comparable MVC framework.
- You’re excited to expand into other languages and frameworks, such as Elixir and Clojure.
- Comfortable in a Unix environment (you know your way around a terminal).
- Experience with deployment and other dev-ops configurations with technologies like Heroku and/or AWS services (S3, EC2, ECS).
- Bonus for proficiency in front-end technology such as Ember, Backbone, and/or React.
