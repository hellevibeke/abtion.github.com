      <p>Together with the cool people from Advance and Idea & daugthers, we have produced a handful of games for LEGO. Unlike their blocks LEGO is anything but square and it's a real pleasure having the opportunity to work in their universe of colors and fun shapes. Latest release is "Who is in the mix" - a game build on the series Mixels. Mixels consist of numerous funny characters that can be "mixed" in all directions and thus create new characters. In "Who is in the mix" you have to gues which caracters who have been mixed.</p>

      <h3>Smoth flow</h3>
      <p>
        Når man udvikler et spil er der som oftest langt fra den indlende idé om hvordan spillets flow skal være, til det endelige resultat. Det er alt fra små animationer til overordnede principper på gameplay niveau der bliver justeret et utal af gange, før det føles helt rigtigt.

      <h3>Parent friendly sounds</h3>
      <p>
        We were careful not make the sounds too enervating - it is stressful enough that your kid has lice. The result is a soft sound universe that is both engaging for the child and cheerfull - almost meditative - for the parents.

      <h3>No text allowed</h3>
      <p>
        The game should be for everyone. Therefore all text was banned from the very beginning. This made great demands on the design, but the solution is a game that is so intuitive that even the youngst children immediately understands what it is about.
