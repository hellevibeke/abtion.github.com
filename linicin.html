    <h3>No words allowed</h3>
    <p>The game should be for everyone. Therefore all words was banned from the very beginning. This made great demands on the design, but the solution is a game that is so intuitive that even the youngst children immediately understands what it is about.</p>

      <h3>Parent friendly sounds</h3>
      <p>We were careful not make the sounds too enervating - it is stressful enough that your kid has lice. The result is a soft sound universe that is both engaging for the child and cheerfull - almost meditative - for the parents.</p>
